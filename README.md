# Mission Report Button Plus

Adds a right-click menu to the mission report button on the minimap for selecting reports from previous expansions.  
*(See full feature list [below](#features))*

## Problem

As soon as a new WoW extension comes out the button on the minimap which opens the mission report frame is disabled until you reach the max. level of that extension and after you meet certain criteria in order to send your little helpers on missions. But only the reports to missions of the current extension can be viewed by the now _replaced_ minimap button, with _no other options_ to view 'older' reports any more unless you visit your old mission tables, and often only to find out that your too early and your missions are _not ready_.  
I was very pleased to see that the WoW Companion app for mobile phones addressed this problem, but the main game still doesn't.

## Solution

It is still possible to access mission reports from previous extensions, but the Blizzard devs still haven't implemented a possibility for users to access it via the graphical interface. So here comes this add-on to work:

+ it adds a right-click menu to the already available minimap button for mission reports,
+ with a selection of mission reports of previous extensions, which are...
+ **anytime and anywhere accessible.**

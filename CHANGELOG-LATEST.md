## Latest Changes

⚠️ **Note:** _This is a pre-release version and still in development._ ⚠️

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

* Updated TOC file version to `WoW 11.0.2`.
* Settings: the settings frame can now be toggled from each source, eg. as slash command in chat, via right-click menu or addon compartment.
* Settings: updated the tooltip for the Appearance shortcut button.
* Settings: addressed some changes in the new game version.
* Dragonflight: updated all World Map events.

### Fixed

* Data: getting the Landing Page's garrison type can return empty values (nil) instead of zero (0) which caused an error.
* Addon Compartment: the click handler's argument types have been changed in the pre-expansion patch and couldn't be processed correctly.
* Tooltip: fixed UI scaling of the expansion details tooltip.
* World Map Events: not all events appeared in the tooltip, since changes made by Blizzard in the pre-expansion patch.

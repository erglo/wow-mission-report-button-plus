### Added

- New line for contributed translations in the about this addon section in the settings.
- New locale `zhTW`, thanks to [EK (EKE00372)](https://github.com/EKE00372).
- The Addon Compartment entry is now optional and can be de-/activated in the settings.
- Dragonflight: added details for the events `Dragonriding Race`, `Camp Aylaag`, `Grand Hunts`, `Siege on Dragonbane Keep` and `Elemental Storms` to the Addon Compartment.
- Warlords of Draenor: the `Garrison Invasion alert icon` on top of the Garrison Landing Page (Mission) Report frame can now be hidden permanently, even if your Garrison is being invaded.

### Changed

- Updated locale files, localizations will now be automatically integrated from CurseForge during GitHub workflow.
- Updated readme files and added a _Thank You!_ section for the contributors.
- Dragonflight: the `Aylaag Camp` entry now additionally shows the name of the closest flight point for easier camp location identification.

### Removed

- Some of the world map icons have been merged in `WoW 10.0.7` which led to the problem that the details about the `Iskaara Community Feast` event on the Dragon Isles can no longer be retrieved by its area POI icon and had to be removed.

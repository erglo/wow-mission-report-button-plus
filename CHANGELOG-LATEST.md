### Fixed

* Settings: an error occurred with the multiple font dropdown menus due to the most recent hotfix from Blizzard. As of now using only 1 variable for more than 1 setting control is no longer allowed. (Thanks go to [zaphon](https://github.com/zaphon) for the hyperlink to the Blizzard changes and the others for reporting this quickly.)

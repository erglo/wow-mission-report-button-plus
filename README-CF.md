<h2>About this add-on</h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>As soon as a new WoW expansion has been released the button on the minimap which opens the mission report frame (aka. <code>Garrison-/ExpansionLandingPageMinimapButton</code>) is disabled until our character meets certain criteria in order to send our little helper companions on missions or until we see any expansion summary. But only the reports from the current expansion can be viewed by the newly <em>replaced</em> minimap button with <em>no other options</em> on how to view reports of any previous expansions anymore unless we visit the old mission tables, and in many cases we do so only to find out that we're too early and our missions are still on-going.<br/>
I was very pleased to see that the WoW Companion app for mobile phones addressed this problem, but unfortunately the main game still doesn't.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>It is still possible to access mission reports from previous expansions but the Blizzard Devs still haven't implemented a possibility for users to access those via the graphical interface. <strong>This is where this addon comes into play:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it makes the minimap button for mission reports available in case it has been hidden,</li>
<li>it adds a right-click menu to the minimap button,</li>
<li>with a selection of unlocked expansions and access to eg. mission reports, bounty quests, summaries, etc. which are...</li>
<li><strong>anytime and anywhere accessible.</strong><br/>
<em>(See full feature list above.)</em></li>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>[FIXED] When opening the garrison landing page of Draenor with an <em>upgraded</em> character an recursion error occurs. The game expects a list with mission details but receives empty values instead. I will tend to this as soon as possible, but it seems to be a sever-side problem at first glance.</li>
<li>[FIXED] When using MRBP together with <em>cfxfox</em>'s addon <a href="https://beta.curseforge.com/wow/addons/war-plan" rel="nofollow">War Plan</a> the minimap button's right-click handler was overridden showing only War Plan's dropdown menu. This has been fixed.<br/>
<em>In case of other addons doing something similar I added the slash command <code>hook</code>, which simply re-registers the MRBP's button hooks (tooltip + right-click menu).</em></li>
<li>[FIXED] As soon as you unlock a command table the minimap button doesn't update automatically. The addon gathers this information only once at startup in order to save memory. You need to reload the UI manually, eg. by typing <code>/reload</code> in the chat frame. Logging-out and -in again also works. I will tend to this as soon as possible.</li>

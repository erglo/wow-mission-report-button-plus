Adds a right-click menu to the mission report button on the minimap (aka. the `Garrison-/ExpansionLandingPageMinimapButton`) for selecting mission reports and summaries of current and previous expansions.

## About this add-on  
  
### Problem  
  
As soon as a new WoW expansion has been released the button on the minimap which opens the mission report frame is disabled until our character meets certain criteria in order to send our little helper companions on missions or until we see any expansion summary. But only the reports from the current expansion can be viewed by the now *replaced* minimap button with *no other options* than to view reports of any previous expansions anymore unless we visit the old mission tables, and in many cases only to find out that we're too early and our missions are still on-going and can't be finished.  
I was very pleased to see that the WoW Companion app for mobile phones addressed this problem, but unfortunately the main game still doesn't.  
  
### Solution  
  
It is still possible to access mission reports from previous expansions but the Blizzard Devs still haven't implemented a possibility for users to access those via the graphical interface. **So here comes this addon to work:**  
  
+ it makes the minimap button for mission reports available, if it has been hidden,  
+ it adds a right-click menu to the minimap button,  
+ with a selection of unlocked expansions and access to eg. mission reports, bounty quests, summaries, etc. which are...  
+ **anytime and anywhere accessible.**

### Known Issues  
  
+ When opening the garrison landing page of Draenor with an *upgraded* character an recursion error occurs. The game expects a list with mission details but receives empty values instead. I will tend to this as soon as possible, but it seems to be a sever-side problem at first glance.  
+ [FIXED] When using MRBP together with *cfxfox*'s addon [War Plan](https://beta.curseforge.com/wow/addons/war-plan) the minimap button's right-click handler was overridden showing only War Plan's dropdown menu. This has been fixed.  
*In case of other addons doing something similar I added the slash command `hook`, which simply re-registers the MRBP's button hooks (tooltip + right-click menu).*  
+ As soon as you unlock a command table the minimap button doesn't update automatically. The addon gathers this information only once at startup in order to save memory. You need to reload the UI manually, eg. by typing `/reload` in the chat frame. Logging-out and -in again also works. I will tend to this as soon as possible.
